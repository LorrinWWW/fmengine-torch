# Installation

We are not providing any pre-built releases at the moment, due to the complexity of the requirements and dependencies. A singularity image is provided, with all environment bundled in and can be used as a starting point.

Currently, fmengine supports two model family: [GPT-Neox]() and [Llama]().
